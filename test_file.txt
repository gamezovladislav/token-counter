This is a test file for the token counter application.
It contains multiple lines of text to count tokens.
The token count will vary depending on the model used.

OpenAI and Anthropic models tokenize text differently.
This file will help us verify that the .env configuration is working correctly.

We've set the default model to gpt-4o in our .env file, so this should be used
if we don't specify a model on the command line.
